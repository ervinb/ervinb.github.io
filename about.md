title: About me
---

Hi, I'm Ervin Barta, a dev/ops guy who worked on [SemaphoreCI][semaphore], a continuous
integration and deployment service, developed by the fine gentleman over at
[Rendered Text][rt]. 

I was mostly responsible for managing and the development of the system, which uses
different virtualization and container technologies ([KVM][kvm], [LXC][lxc],
[Docker][docker]) to execute jobs related to continuous integration and deployment.
I also wrote a few articles on [Semaphore Community][semaphore-community] and did
technical support for the CI platform.

These days, I do consulting with a focus on Go and Kubernetes.

In my free time, I like to fiddle with the nuts and bolts of everything which
ticks or has >= 2 wheels. I'm passionate about running, motorcycles and
landscapes.

### About this blog

I would like to share anything interesting what I come along while programming,
fixing computers or watching paint dry. This is a dump of my adventures in
front of different computer screens, occasionally, far away from them. I hope
some of the tips here will save you from a few hair-pulling sessions.
