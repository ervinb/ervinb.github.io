Application shortcuts can be added to Unity by creating special `.desktop` files
in `/usr/share/applications/`. These shortcut definitions appear in the Dash from
where they can be dragged to the Unity launcher.

## Creating a simple shortcut

These files follow a simple syntax: they consist of groups and key-value
pairs. Groups are used to define additional options in the shortcut's context menu.
For example, switching to the next track in a music player. We will demonstrate
this later.

The `.desktop` file is required to contain the group `[Desktop Entry]` with a set of
key-value pairs.

Some formatting rules to keep in mind:

  - no whitespace should be present around the equal signs
  - values can be one of: `string`, `localestring`, `numeric`, `boolean`
  - adding `#` to the beginning of the line marks that line as a comment

#### Shortcut for Android Studio

{% highlight bash %}
[Desktop Entry]

# required
Type=Application
Name=Android Studio
Exec=/opt/android-studio/bin/studio.sh
# optional
Icon=/opt/android-studio/bin/studio.png
{% endhighlight %}

This is the minimal amount of information you need to provide to create a valid
shortcut with an icon, which will appear in Dash. The most important key is `Exec`.
This line gets executed when the shortcut is clicked.

After saving the file to `/usr/share/applications/android-studio.desktop`,
the shortcut should appear in Dash and it can be added to Unity's launcher.

## Advanced application shortcuts

Now, let's see a more feature-rich application launcher. Rhythmbox is a good
candidate. Its' client has a wide variety of options to control the application,
which we will put to good use.

If the player is installed, a `rhythmbox.desktop` file should already be present
on your machine. Open up a text editor and let's see what we got.

`sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/rhythmbox.desktop`

```shell
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Rhythmbox
GenericName=Music Player
X-GNOME-FullName=Rhythmbox Music Player
Comment=Play and organize your music collection
Keywords=Audio;Song;MP3;CD;Podcast;MTP;iPod;Playlist;Last.fm;UPnP;DLNA;Radio;
Exec=rhythmbox %U
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Icon=rhythmbox
X-GNOME-DocPath=rhythmbox/rhythmbox.xml
Categories=GNOME;GTK;AudioVideo;Audio;Player;
MimeType=application/x-ogg;application/ogg;audio/x-vorbis+ogg;audio/x-scpls;audio/x-mp3;audio/x-mpeg;audio/mpeg;audio/x-mpegurl;audio/x-flac;audio/mp4;x-scheme-handler/itms;x-sche>
StartupNotify=true
X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Bugzilla=GNOME
X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Product=rhythmbox
X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Component=general
X-GNOME-Bugzilla-OtherBinaries=rhythmbox-client;rhythmbox-metadata;
X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Version=3.0.2
X-GNOME-UsesNotifications=true
X-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=rhythmbox
Actions=Play;Pause;Next;Previous;

[Desktop Action Play]
Name=Play
Exec=rhythmbox-client --play

[Desktop Action Pause]
Name=Pause
Exec=rhythmbox-client --pause

[Desktop Action Next]
Name=Next
Exec=rhythmbox-client --next

[Desktop Action Previous]
Name=Previous
Exec=rhythmbox-client --previous           
```

There is a surprising amount of information a shortcut can hold isn't it?
The most interesting part for us is the `Actions` key and the definitions
of different actions below it.

#### Our first action

Rhythmbox's client has an option which toggles Play and Pause. Let's join the
Play and Resume actions together. The new action will be called `PlayPause`.
Really innovative. Actually, let's call it `iPlayPause`. Remove these two
group definitions: `[Desktop Action Play]` and `[Desktop Action Pause]`. Also,
remove them from the list of actions in the `Actions` key. Next, add our new
action to the actions list and define the new group. The example below shows only
the relevant lines.

```shell
Actions=iPlayPause;Next;Previous;

[Desktop Action iPlayPause]
Name=Play | Pause
Exec=rhythmbox-client --play-pause

[Desktop Action Next]
Name=Next
Exec=rhythmbox-client --next

[Desktop Action Previous]
Name=Previous
Exec=rhythmbox-client --previous           
```

#### Our second and third actions

When you hear an awesome song for the first time, you might want to throw
a bunch of stars at it, so having an action for that may be useful. Create
a new action for rating the current song. Heck, let's add another action,
which will trigger a notification with the name of the currently playing track.

```shell
Actions=iPlayPause;Next;Previous;Rate;NowPlaying;

[Desktop Action iPlayPause]
Name=Play | Pause
Exec=rhythmbox-client --play-pause

[Desktop Action Next]
Name=Next
Exec=rhythmbox-client --next

[Desktop Action Previous]
Name=Previous
Exec=rhythmbox-client --previous

[Desktop Action Rate]                                                                                             
Name=Epic!
Exec=sh -c 'rhythmbox-client --set-rating 5'

[Desktop Action NowPlaying]
Name=Now playing
Exec=sh -c 'rhythmbox-client --print-playing | xargs -0 -I track notify-send -t
3 -a Rhythmbox -i rhythmbox track'
```

To list all the available Rhytmbox controls, run `rhythmbox-client --help` in
your terminal.

## Wrapping up

As you saw, creating shortcuts can be fun and the options are literally limitless.
For a more detailed reference for all available options (localization might interest you),
refer to [Desktop Entry Specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html).
Until next time!
