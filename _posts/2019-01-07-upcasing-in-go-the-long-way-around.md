# Checking a character's case in Go, the long way around (0's and 1's included)

I'm slowly picking up Go, and ran across a [Hacker Rank][hackerrank] task: count the number of uppercase letters, in an
input, which is written in CamelCase. For example, thisStringWouldYield 3.

It's easy as it sounds: you go through each character and increase a counter if it's in uppercase. ([playground][playcounter])

```Go
func camelCount(in string) int {
	counter := 0

	for _, ch := range in {
	  if (unicode.IsUpper(ch)){
	    counter++
	  }
	}
	
  return counter
}
```

... but as regexes, exiting Vim, and character encodings [link to SO dev post] are often a weak point of
many of us, I've decided to dig deeper, and see how Go implements `IsUpper`. It turned out
to be a good refresher about some basics, which often get overlooked or are taken for granted.

### Understanding the problem

Let me throw in a couple of words, and see which we know and which we think we know: ASCII, ANSI, UTF8, UTF16, code point, runes.

<nugget>
Encoding tldr;

- ASCII is a character set
# ASCII: 0:32[special char] - 33:128 [a-z,A-Z letters] - 129:255 [code pages: Greek, Esperanto, etc.]

# decimal: 137 = 1×10^2+3×10^1+7×10^0 = 100+30+7
# hex: 3B = 3×16^1+11×16^0 = 48+11 = 5910
# https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html

# Unicode: platonic 'A' -> code point: U+0041 -> encode to store in memory: UTF8
#   UTF8: store the first 128 characters in 1 byte = ASCII, 

# 1 hex digit represents half-a-byte(nibble): a base 16 digit can represent 0-15d which in binary can be described with 4 bits (half a byte) 2^4

A string is a sequence of bytes. Each byte represents a Unicode [code point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point), which is a mapping of a single value to a character. Golang's `rune` type is another way of saying `int32`. The type is used to point to Unicode code points: [41][unicodea] in `41 -> 'A'` is a rune.


All these characters on your screen are defined in the Unicode table, and are encoded in UTF-8. Each character has its decimal representation, along with Hex or
any other format you fancy.

The upper case "A" is for example represented with a decimal 41 in the table; where lowercase "A" is at 61. So, a question arises, is there a function (like adding/subtracting 20)
which can easily change the character's case? The answer is more simple, and more complicated at the same time.

We don't need any fancy algorithm because everything is hardcoded in the programming language. We have a huge table of hardcoded mappings, from which we get what we need, and continue with our day.

The "get what we need" is where it gets interesting.


I will break down the code examples as much as I can, to assure a firm base for understanding the implementation. This will
include some Golang and general programming concepts.

## isUpcase

The implementation is suspiciously short: 

```Go
func IsUpper(r rune) bool {
	if uint32(r) <= MaxLatin1 {
		return properties[uint8(r)] & pLmask == pLu
	}

	return isExcludingLatin(Upper, r)
}
```

We will focus on understanding line 3, in depth.

```Go
return properties[uint8(r)] & pLmask == pLu
```

We're accessing an array called `properties` with an 8-bit integer index derived from the character, have some kind of a bitmask, and `pLu` whatever that is.
Let's address these one by one.


#### Flags and bitmasks

If we look up the definition of `pLmask` ((src/unicode/graphic.go)[https://golang.org/src/unicode/graphic.go#8]), the first reaction might be to switch to the YouTube tab you have sitting next to
the current one, but let's fight that urge and see what we have here. 

```
const (
  _ = 1 << iota
  ...
  pLl
  pLu
  ...
  pLmask = pLu | pLl
```

Yes, this is how Pandora's box looks like. If you're fluent in Go and bitwise operations, switch to that YouTube tab until the rest of us finish here.

*Q*: Why aren't all the elements defined, if these are constants?

*A*: They are. The missing type and value just means to repeat the line above as long as it doesn't encounter an equals sign. [link to iota]
A property of Go's `iota` is to auto-increment as it moves through the list with each new line. 

```Go
const (
  a = 0 + iota   # => 0 + 0 = 0
  b              # => 0 + 1 = 1
  c              # => 0 + 2 = 2
)
```


*Q*: _tries to skim over '_ = 1 << iota'_

*A*: The elefant at the top, known as a left bitwise shift, is one of the rarer operations you'll see in your everyday life, and it's like seeing a full kitchen sink - you reflexively look away.
Bitwise operations are usually used to represent flags. Pseudo code, describing ships and a vacation comming up; we've arrived to 0's and 1's, but it's fun I promise. 

```
slipperyDeck   = 1 # binary: 0001
onboardPool    = 2 # binary: 0010
captainOnBoard = 4 # binary: 0100
freeSnacks     = 8 # binary: 1000

```

The values are not arbitary: `1` in the binary representation of the flag is always on a different place, and it never clashes with another flag.
If we were looking for a ship with a swimming pool, and we're into slippery decks, we combine `onboardPool` with `slipperyDeck`:

```
vacationCriteria = slipperyDeck | onboardPool # 0001 | 0010 = 0011
```

Flags are combined with the logical `OR` operation, represented with `|`. Also our `vacationCriteria` is what is called a bitmask. We use bitmasks, to see if a flag is set or not. Applying the `AND` (`&`) operation to a mask and the flag
tells us if the flag is active or not in that mask.

For example, we found a potential ship. Let's check if it fits our needs:

```
ship = 15 # binary: 1111
packBags if (ship & vacationCriteria) # 1111 & 0011 = 0011, which is 'true' => packBags
```

It does. Conveniently, it also has a `captainOnBoard` and `freeSnacks`.

When defining the flags, to spare our brain cycles from moving the binary `1` without clashing with other flags, we use bitwise left shift `<<`. It does exactly we've done above.
An interesting property of this operation is that the end result of `x << y` can be calculated with `x * 2^y`.

Back to the flag definitions in `unicode/graphic.go`.

```
const (
  _ = 1 << iota       // 1 << 0 = 00001 << 0 => 00000001 (1 * 2^0 = 1)
  ...                 // four other flags defined here
  pLl                 // 1 << 5 = 00001 << 5 => 00100000 (1 * 2^5 = 32)
  pLu                 // 1 << 6 = 00001 << 5 => 01000000 (1 * 2^6 = 64)
  ...
  pLmask = pLu | pLl  //                     => 01100000 (32 + 64 = 96)
```

And to make sense of the variable namings: the capital letter refers to Unicode categories: Letter, Character, Space, Other.
The ending lowercase letter is, as you probably already guessed, referring to `lowercase` or `uppercase`.

So `pLmask` is a mask, which has the uppercase and lowercase flags set to true. By applying a bitwise `&` and a character's properties,
we can check if the character has either the lowercase or uppercase flag set.


### Decyphering our line of interest

We're now armed to decrypt the line from which we started, in 3 quick strokes.

```
properties[r] & pLmask == pLu

```

1. `properties` is an array which stores flags, like our `vacationCriteria` from before. For example at position 41, you'll find:
<TODO: filename>

```
properties = [MaxLatin1 + 1]uint8 {
  ...
	0x41: pLu | pp, // 'A'
  ...
}
```

Conveniently, the position corresponds to the character's number representation in the Unicode table. With `properties[uint(A)]` we get the value of the `pLu | pp` flags.
`pp` means "printable" and it doesn't interfere with our check for `pLu`, as it's not present in `pLmask`.

```
properties[uint("A")] = pLu | pp // 01000000 | 10000000 => 11000000 
```

So based on the above, we know that the capital "A" is printable and that it's uppercase. We will use the value `(pLu | pp)` below, when refering to this `properties` element.

2. The next thing in line is `& pLmask`. With it we check if the value of the given `properties` element, has the `pLmask` flags activated, like we checked if a ship is suitable for our vacation.

```
(pLu | pp) & pLmask // 11000000 & 01100000 => 010000000
```

Again, `(pLu | pp)` is derived from step 1, and it's the value of `properties[uint("A")]`.

3. Lastly, we check if the extracted value is exactly `pLu` ie. is the character is exactly upper case. It can't be `pLu` and `pLl` at the same time. That would make a strange letter.

```
((pLu | pp) & pLmask) == pLu // 010000000 == 010000000, true
```

go playground

Now we can answer the question: what is an uppercase letter in Go?

```
A letter which has the 'pLu' flag set, is an uppercase letter.
```

### End

"A"

Yay an uppercase A!
